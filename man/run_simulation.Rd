\usage{
run_simulation(
  conditions,
  coverageScheme,
  nIterPerCond,
  suffix = "",
  iter = 1000L,
  stanPars = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conditions}{a data frame with simulation conditions, typically
constructed using \link{prepare_conditions}}

\item{coverageScheme}{a data frame with country-year-survey project coverage
scheme (see \link{check_coverage_scheme})}

\item{nIterPerCond}{a positive integer - number of iterations to be run for
each condition}

\item{suffix}{optionally a string - suffix that will be added to the name
of a file storing simulation results (that will be saved to the disk)}

\item{iter}{optionally a positive integer - number of MCMC iterations in
model estimation}

\item{stanPars}{optionally a list with additional arguments that will be
passed to the Stan models' \code{sample} method - see \link{estimate_dcpo} and
\link{estimate_claassen}}
}
\value{
(invisibly) a list of four data frames:
\describe{
\item{modelSummaries}{basic model summary statistics in a \emph{long} format}
\item{countryMeans}{generated country-year means (as returned by
\link{generate_data}, i.e. not standardized) and their
estimates from the models (standardized within the
group of observed country-means)}
\item{items}{item parameters (generated, not estimated)}
\item{itemDistributions}{distributions (counts) of responses to items for
each project-country-year-item}
}
Moreover, after completing each simulation condition-iteration function will
save to the disk file "cntYearTrends_results[suffix].RData" storing the
data frames listed above.
}

Runs the simulation.
