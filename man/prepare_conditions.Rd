\title{Preparing simulation conditions}
\usage{
prepare_conditions(constant, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{constant}{a one-row data frame containing values of parameters that
should be hold constant across all the simulation conditions}

\item{...}{data frames with combinations of values of the other parameters}
}
\value{
a data frame
}
\description{
Prepares a data frame storing simulation conditions. Its arguments should be
data frames giving combinations of simulation parameters.
}
\details{
Each parameter in the list below should be given as a column in exactly one
of the data frames provided as function arguments:

\strong{Projects' characteristics}
\describe{
\item{nRespondents}{ (an integer) - number of respondents in each country}
\item{projectBiasesSD}{ (a number) - std. dev. of the centered-normal distributions from which project biases will be drawn}
\item{nItemsProbs}{ (a string with expression creating a named numeric vector summing up to 1, with names coercing to integers) - probability distribution of a project having a given number of items}
\item{respScaleLengthProbs}{ (a string with expression creating a named numeric vector summing up to 1, with names coercing to integers) - probability distribution of a project having a given length of the response scale}
}
\strong{Country-means and SDs autoregressive process parameters}
\describe{
\item{arMeanStartLB}{ (a number) - lower bound of a uniform distribution from which country means in the first year are drawn}
\item{arMeanStartUB}{ (a number) - lower bound of a uniform distribution from which country means in the first year are drawn}
\item{arMeanChangeSD}{ (a number) - std. dev. of change of country means relatively to the previous year}
\item{arMeanTrendLB}{ (a number) - the lower bound for the mean trend}
\item{arMeanTrendUB}{ (a number) - the upper bound for the mean trend}
\item{arVarStartLB}{ (a number) - the lower bound of a uniform distrib. (of within-countries std. devs. in the first year)}
\item{arVarStartUB}{ (a number) - the upper bound of a uniform distrib. (of within-countries std. devs. in the first year)}
\item{arVarChangeSD}{ (a number) - std. dev. of a multiplicative change of within-country SD relatively to the previous year (this is parameter of a log-normal distrib.)}
}
\strong{Default item parameters}
\describe{
\item{unstLoadingDefault}{ (a number) - unstandardized loading}
\item{difficultyDefault}{ (a number) - mean of the thresholds}
\item{relThresholdsL}{ (a number) - +- this will be set as limits of the uniform distrib.}

\strong{Non-invariance parameters}
\describe{
\item{unstLoadingsCSD}{ (a number) - between-countries non-invariance effect std. dev.}
\item{unstLoadingsYSD}{ (a number) - temporal non-invariance effect std. dev.}
\item{difficultyCSD}{ (a number) - between-countries non-invariance effect std. dev.}
\item{difficultyYSD}{ (a number) - temporal non-invariance effect std. dev.}
}
\strong{Parameters describing the projects' coverage}
\describe{
\item{variant}{ (a string) - the name of the coverage variant}
