## New features

-   Distributions of responses to the items returned as additional element of simulation results.

## Bug fixes

-   `run_simulation()` doesn't fail due to wrongly assessing number of columns storing items' threshold values.
-   Data generating functions consequently use integer as a format for variables storing project, country, year and item ids.
